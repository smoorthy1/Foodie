# Foodie
Foodie is an web based application that allows the users to peruse various foods supplied by the Edamam Recipe Search API, which contains hundreds of thousands of recipes that can be accessed and filtered for select health avoidances or meal types through GET requests using AJAX calls. The application then stores the recipes sent by Edamam that can then allow them to access an inbox where they can type in the recipes they were interested in and use the autocomplete search bar if they are unsure on how to exactly spell the recipe. We used the Google Firebase Console to store authentication information that users must fill out before accessing the application.
